    "2. **Why do we use different dataset splits?**\n",
    "   - **Random split**: Tests generalization to similar compounds\n",
    "   - **Scaffold split**: Tests generalization to structurally different compounds (more realistic)\n",
    "   - **Time split**: Tests prediction of future discoveries\n",
    "\n",

    "🎯 **Core Concepts:**\n",
    "- Multi-task learning for molecular properties\n",
    "- Dataset comparison and selection strategies\n",
    "- Feature engineering for molecules\n",
    "- Model architecture choices for different property types\n",

    "- Working with multiple molecular datasets (toxicity, solubility, lipophilicity)\n",
    "- Comparing classification vs regression tasks\n",
    "- Handling missing data and dataset differences\n",
    "- Evaluating multi-property models\n",
    "\n",
    "💊 **Real-World Applications:**\n",
    "- Drug safety prediction (toxicity screening)\n",
    "- ADMET property prediction (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, Toxicity)\n",
    "- Lead compound optimization\n",
    "- Virtual screening workflows\n",

    "- 🔄 **API Evolution** - Libraries update their interfaces to improve functionality\n",
    "- ⚠️ **Future Changes** - The old way still works, but may be removed later\n",
    "- 📢 **Advance Notice** - Developers get time to update their code\n",

    "#### **Why You See Them Here:**\n",
    "- **DeepChem uses RDKit** internally for molecular operations\n",
    "- **RDKit is updating** their API to be more modern and efficient\n",
    "- **DeepChem hasn't updated yet** to use the newest RDKit functions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **What to Do:**\n",
    "- ✅ **For Learning:** Ignore them - your code works perfectly\n",
    "- ✅ **For Production:** Monitor updates and plan migration when needed\n",
    "- ✅ **For Contributions:** Help update DeepChem to use newer APIs!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Professional Approach:**\n",
    "In real projects, you'd:\n",
    "1. **Document the warnings** in your project README\n",
    "2. **Set up monitoring** for library updates\n",
    "3. **Plan migration** when maintainers announce deprecation timelines\n",
    "4. **Test thoroughly** when updating dependencies\n",

    "### 💡 **For Beginners: My Honest Advice**\n",
    "\n",
    "**If you're learning molecular ML:**\n",
    "- Start with DeepChem to understand concepts\n",
    "- Build custom featurizers to learn RDKit deeply\n",
    "- Use hybrid approach for best of both worlds\n",
    "\n",
    "**If you're building production systems:**\n",
    "- Custom featurizers for clean, maintainable code\n",
    "- DeepChem for proven model architectures\n",
    "- Gradual migration based on specific needs\n",
    "\n",
    "**If you have limited time:**\n",
    "- Stick with DeepChem and ignore deprecation warnings\n",
    "- Focus on understanding the science, not the implementation details\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 **Bottom Line**\n",
    "\n",
    "The deprecation warnings are **not a serious problem**, but building custom RDKit wrappers is:\n",
    "- ✅ **Feasible** (basic features are easy)\n",
    "- ✅ **Educational** (you'll learn a lot)\n",
    "- ✅ **Valuable** (cleaner, more maintainable code)\n",
    "- ❌ **Time-consuming** (full feature parity takes months)\n",
    "\n",
    "**My recommendation**: Start with the hybrid approach I outlined above! 🚀"

    "🎯 **The Core Insight**: Molecular properties are often related!\n",

    "### Multi-Task Learning Benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Shared Representations** → Common molecular features across tasks\n",
    "2. **Transfer Learning** → Knowledge from data-rich tasks helps data-poor tasks  \n",
    "3. **Improved Generalization** → Less overfitting by learning multiple objectives\n",
    "4. **Efficient Training** → One model for multiple properties\n",
    "\n",
    "### Our Strategy:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Toxicity Model**: 12-task classifier for different toxicity assays\n",
    "- **Property Model**: Regression for solubility prediction\n",
    "- **Feature Sharing**: Same ECFP features for both models\n",
    "- **Performance Comparison**: Classification vs regression approaches\n",

    "This mirrors real drug discovery where you need **simultaneous** predictions for safety, efficacy, and drug-likeness!"

    "\n",
    "### 🚀 Best Practices for Real Drug Discovery Projects\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Dataset Strategy**\n",
    "- **Always use multiple datasets** - Properties are interconnected\n",
    "- **Check data quality** - Missing values, outliers, and dataset bias\n",
    "- **Understand your domains** - Different assays measure different aspects\n",
    "- **Consider data imbalance** - Toxicity assays often have few positives\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Feature Engineering**\n",
