    "\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrates how to use DeepChem for **multi-property molecular machine learning** - a critical skill in drug discovery where you need to predict multiple molecular properties simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What You'll Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "🎯 **Core Concepts:**\n",
    "- Multi-task learning for molecular properties\n",
    "- Dataset comparison and selection strategies\n",
    "- Feature engineering for molecules\n",
    "- Model architecture choices for different property types\n",
    "\n",
    "🧪 **Practical Skills:**\n",
    "- Working with multiple molecular datasets (toxicity, solubility, lipophilicity)\n",
    "- Comparing classification vs regression tasks\n",
    "- Handling missing data and dataset differences\n",
    "- Evaluating multi-property models\n",
    "\n",
    "💊 **Real-World Applications:**\n",
    "- Drug safety prediction (toxicity screening)\n",
    "- ADMET property prediction (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, Toxicity)\n",

    "\n",
    "#### **What Deprecation Warnings Mean:**\n",
    "- 🔄 **API Evolution** - Libraries update their interfaces to improve functionality\n",
    "- ⚠️ **Future Changes** - The old way still works, but may be removed later\n",
    "- 📢 **Advance Notice** - Developers get time to update their code\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Why You See Them Here:**\n",
    "- **DeepChem uses RDKit** internally for molecular operations\n",
    "- **RDKit is updating** their API to be more modern and efficient\n",
    "- **DeepChem hasn't updated yet** to use the newest RDKit functions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **What to Do:**\n",
    "- ✅ **For Learning:** Ignore them - your code works perfectly\n",
    "- ✅ **For Production:** Monitor updates and plan migration when needed\n",
    "- ✅ **For Contributions:** Help update DeepChem to use newer APIs!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Professional Approach:**\n",
    "In real projects, you'd:\n",
    "1. **Document the warnings** in your project README\n",
    "2. **Set up monitoring** for library updates\n",
    "3. **Plan migration** when maintainers announce deprecation timelines\n",
    "4. **Test thoroughly** when updating dependencies\n",

    "### 💡 **For Beginners: My Honest Advice**\n",
    "\n",
    "**If you're learning molecular ML:**\n",
    "- Start with DeepChem to understand concepts\n",
    "- Build custom featurizers to learn RDKit deeply\n",
    "- Use hybrid approach for best of both worlds\n",
    "\n",
    "**If you're building production systems:**\n",
    "- Custom featurizers for clean, maintainable code\n",
    "- DeepChem for proven model architectures\n",
    "- Gradual migration based on specific needs\n",
    "\n",
    "**If you have limited time:**\n",
    "- Stick with DeepChem and ignore deprecation warnings\n",
    "- Focus on understanding the science, not the implementation details\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 **Bottom Line**\n",
    "\n",
    "The deprecation warnings are **not a serious problem**, but building custom RDKit wrappers is:\n",
    "- ✅ **Feasible** (basic features are easy)\n",
    "- ✅ **Educational** (you'll learn a lot)\n",
    "- ✅ **Valuable** (cleaner, more maintainable code)\n",
    "- ❌ **Time-consuming** (full feature parity takes months)\n",
    "\n",
    "**My recommendation**: Start with the hybrid approach I outlined above! 🚀"

    "1. **Shared Representations** → Common molecular features across tasks\n",
    "2. **Transfer Learning** → Knowledge from data-rich tasks helps data-poor tasks  \n",
    "3. **Improved Generalization** → Less overfitting by learning multiple objectives\n",
    "4. **Efficient Training** → One model for multiple properties\n",

    "### Our Strategy:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Toxicity Model**: 12-task classifier for different toxicity assays\n",
    "- **Property Model**: Regression for solubility prediction\n",
    "- **Feature Sharing**: Same ECFP features for both models\n",
    "- **Performance Comparison**: Classification vs regression approaches\n",

    "## Step 5: Key Takeaways & Best Practices for Multi-Property Drug Discovery\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎓 What You've Learned\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations! You've just built a comprehensive multi-property drug discovery pipeline. Here's what you've accomplished:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ✅ **Technical Skills Gained:**\n",
    "1. **Multi-dataset loading** - Handling toxicity, solubility, and other molecular properties\n",
    "2. **Feature engineering comparison** - Testing ECFP, Morgan, RDKit, and Coulomb features\n",
    "3. **Multi-task modeling** - Building both classification and regression models\n",
    "4. **Model evaluation** - Using appropriate metrics for different task types\n",
    "5. **Practical screening** - Applying models to real drug candidate evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ✅ **Drug Discovery Concepts Mastered:**\n",
    "1. **ADMET prediction** - The foundation of drug safety and efficacy\n",
    "2. **Multi-property optimization** - Balancing safety, efficacy, and drug-likeness\n",
    "3. **Transfer learning** - Using knowledge from one property to help another\n",
    "4. **Virtual screening** - Computational compound prioritization\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🚀 Best Practices for Real Drug Discovery Projects\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Dataset Strategy**\n",
    "- **Always use multiple datasets** - Properties are interconnected\n",
    "- **Check data quality** - Missing values, outliers, and dataset bias\n",
    "- **Understand your domains** - Different assays measure different aspects\n",
    "- **Consider data imbalance** - Toxicity assays often have few positives\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Feature Engineering**\n",
    "- **Start with ECFP** - Excellent general-purpose molecular features\n",
    "- **Add physicochemical descriptors** - Important for ADMET properties\n",
    "- **Consider 3D features** - For properties dependent on molecular shape\n",
    "- **Test feature combinations** - Different properties may need different features\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Model Architecture**\n",
    "- **Multi-task when appropriate** - Related properties benefit from shared learning\n",
    "- **Use appropriate metrics** - ROC-AUC for classification, R² for regression\n",
    "- **Regularize heavily** - Molecular datasets are often small\n",
    "- **Cross-validate properly** - Avoid molecular similarity in train/test splits\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Validation & Deployment**\n",
    "- **Test on external datasets** - Ensure generalizability\n",
    "- **Consider uncertainty** - Report confidence intervals\n",
    "- **Validate experimentally** - Computational predictions need wet-lab confirmation\n",
    "- **Monitor model drift** - Retrain as new data becomes available\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔬 Extending This Work\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Immediate Extensions:**\n",
    "- Add more datasets (ClinTox, SIDER, BACE, etc.)\n",
    "- Test graph neural networks (GraphConv, AttentiveFP)\n",
    "- Implement ensemble methods\n",
    "- Add uncertainty quantification\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Advanced Projects:**\n",
    "- **Multi-objective optimization** - Pareto-optimal compound design\n",
    "- **Active learning** - Intelligently selecting experiments\n",
    "- **Generative models** - Designing new compounds with desired properties\n",
    "- **Protein-target integration** - Adding target binding predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 Real-World Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial prepares you for:\n",
    "- **Pharmaceutical companies** - Lead optimization and safety screening\n",
    "- **Biotech startups** - Rapid compound prioritization\n",
    "- **Academic research** - Chemical biology and drug discovery\n",
    "- **CROs** - Providing computational services to pharma\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📚 Next Steps for Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **DeepChem documentation** - Explore more models and datasets\n",
    "2. **RDKit tutorials** - Deep dive into cheminformatics\n",
    "3. **Molecular machine learning papers** - Stay current with research\n",
    "4. **Drug discovery textbooks** - Understand the biological context\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember: **Computational predictions are powerful, but they're tools to guide experimental work, not replace it!**"
