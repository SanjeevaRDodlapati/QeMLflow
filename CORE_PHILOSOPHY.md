### TESTING PHILOSOPHY

#### Test Hierarchy (by importance)
1. **Core Scientific Tests (90% of effort)**

## CONCLUSION

This philosophy document serves as our north star for all decisions regarding QeMLflow development, maintenance, and evolution. Every code change, feature addition, architectural decision, and refactoring effort should be evaluated against these principles.

**The ultimate question for every decision:** *"Does this directly serve our mission of providing a lean, enterprise-grade, production-ready platform for molecular and quantum computing?"*

If the answer is not a clear "yes," the change should be reconsidered or redesigned to better align with our core philosophy.
