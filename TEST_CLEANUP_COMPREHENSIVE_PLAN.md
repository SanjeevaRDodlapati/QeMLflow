# QeMLflow Test Suite Cleanup Plan
# ===================================
# 
# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:
# Current state: 63 test files, 31,077 lines, 1.7MB
# Target: ~15-20 essential test files, ~8,000-10,000 lines, <800KB
# Reduction: ~70% reduction in test code while maintaining coverage of core functionality
#
# CORE PHILOSOPHY ALIGNMENT:
# - Keep only tests that validate core scientific computing capabilities
# - Remove redundant enterprise feature tests not directly related to molecular/quantum computing
# - Eliminate legacy, duplicate, and over-engineered test scenarios
# - Focus on essential functionality that supports the lean, production-ready scientific platform

## PHASE 1: CRITICAL ASSESSMENT & CATEGORIZATION (CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS)

## PHASE 2: DETAILED CLEANUP STRATEGY

### PHASE 2A: IMMEDIATE REMOVALS (Safe to delete)
1. **tests/legacy/** - Complete removal
   - Contains 8 files, 1,998 lines of legacy test code
   - Legacy VAE, model fixes, and outdated functionality
   - RATIONALE: Already identified as legacy, not part of core platform

2. **tests/high_availability/** - Complete removal  
   - 443 lines of redundancy, failover, disaster recovery tests
   - RATIONALE: Enterprise HA features not core to scientific computing platform

3. **tests/scalability/** - Complete removal
   - 748 lines of scaling and load balancing tests
   - RATIONALE: Scalability is handled at infrastructure level, not core functionality

4. **test_infrastructure.py** - Review and minimize
   - Likely infrastructure testing not related to core algorithms

### PHASE 2B: SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS (Keep essentials only)
1. **tests/observability/** (3,155 lines → ~500 lines)
   - Keep: Basic monitoring, essential health checks
   - Remove: Complex dashboards, detailed analytics, code health analysis
   - Files to minimize: test_dashboard.py, test_code_health.py, test_monitoring.py

2. **tests/production_readiness/** (1,749 lines → ~300 lines)
   - Keep: Basic deployment validation
   - Remove: Complex enterprise readiness checks, detailed compliance

3. **tests/performance/** (712 lines → ~200 lines)
   - Keep: Core algorithm benchmarks only
   - Remove: Infrastructure performance tests, detailed profiling

4. **tests/security/** (569 lines → ~150 lines)  
   - Keep: Basic input validation, essential security checks
   - Remove: Complex enterprise security features

### PHASE 2C: UNIT TEST CONSOLIDATION (16,273 lines → ~6,000 lines)
**CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF tests/unit/ files:**

**KEEP AS-IS (Core Scientific):**
- test_qsar_modeling_comprehensive.py (~1,285 lines) - Essential QSAR
- test_feature_extraction_high_impact.py (10,588 lines) - BUT REDUCE by 50%
- test_metrics_high_impact.py (3,662 lines) - Essential metrics
- test_data_processing.py (9,989 lines) - BUT REDUCE by 60%

**CONSOLIDATE & REDUCE:**
- test_feature_extraction_comprehensive.py (41,792 lines) - MASSIVE - Reduce by 80%
- test_ml_utils_comprehensive.py (37,407 lines) - MASSIVE - Reduce by 80%

**REMOVE COMPLETELY:**
- test_models.py - Already disabled (missing legacy models)
- Empty/placeholder files like test_chemml_common_comprehensive.py
- Redundant "surgical" and multiple comprehensive versions of same functionality

### PHASE 2D: INTEGRATION & WORKFLOW TESTS (Minimal retention)
- Keep 1-2 essential end-to-end workflow tests
- Remove complex pipeline integration tests
- Focus on core molecular processing workflows only

## PHASE 3: IMPLEMENTATION PHASES

### PHASE 3A: IMMEDIATE DELETIONS (Low Risk)
**Target: Remove ~40% of test code immediately**
```bash
# Safe to delete - no core functionality impact
rm -rf tests/legacy/
rm -rf tests/high_availability/  
rm -rf tests/scalability/
rm tests/unit/test_models.py  # Already disabled
rm tests/unit/test_chemml_common_comprehensive.py  # Empty
rm tests/integration/test_pipelines.py  # Already disabled
```

### PHASE 3B: OBSERVABILITY & ENTERPRISE MINIMIZATION
