└── README.md                              # Keep - navigation guide
```

**Actions**:
- **KEEP**: CORE_PHILOSOPHY_ALIGNMENT_ANALYSIS.md (essential)
- **MERGE**: 6 comprehensive reports → 1 status report

---

### 3. **docs/getting-started/** - ✅ **MINOR OPTIMIZATION**

**Current State**: 5 files, some redundancy
- QUICK_START.md vs legacy_quick_start.md overlap
- Multiple entry points causing confusion

**Recommendation**: **OPTIMIZE TO 3 FILES**
```
getting-started/
├── README.md                    # Merge index.md content
├── quick_start.md              # Merge QUICK_START.md + legacy
└── learning_paths.md           # Keep - valuable navigation
```

**Actions**:
- **MERGE**: QUICK_START.md + legacy_quick_start.md → quick_start.md
- **MERGE**: index.md → README.md
- **REMOVE**: user_guide.md (move to user-guide/)

---

### 4. **docs/reference/** - ✅ **GOOD STRUCTURE**

**Current State**: Well organized, minimal redundancy
**Recommendation**: **KEEP WITH MINOR ADJUSTMENTS**
```

└── technical/                  # Keep - essential
```

**Actions**: Add README.md for navigation

---

### 5. **docs/user-guide/** - ⚠️ **NEEDS EXPANSION**

**Current State**: Only 3 files, needs consolidation from other areas
**Recommendation**: **EXPAND TO 6 FILES**
```
user-guide/
├── README.md                    # Navigation guide
├── user_guide.md               # Move from getting-started/
├── features_guide.md           # Rename ENHANCED_FEATURES_GUIDE.md
├── performance_guide.md        # Keep - valuable
├── best_practices.md           # New - consolidate best practices

---

### 8. **ROOT docs/ FILES** - ⚠️ **NEEDS ORGANIZATION**

**Current State**: 4 scattered files
**Recommendation**: **ORGANIZE AND OPTIMIZE**
```
docs/
├── README.md                           # Main navigation hub
├── index.md                           # Keep - documentation index
