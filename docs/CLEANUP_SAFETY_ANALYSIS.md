# üîç SAFETY ANALYSIS: aggressive_lean_cleanup.py

## ‚úÖ **SCRIPT SAFETY AFTER MODIFICATIONS**

### **‚úÖ SAFE Operations:**
1. **Cache Removal**: `.mypy_cache`, `.pytest_cache`, `__pycache__` - These are regeneratable
2. **Empty Directory Removal**: Only removes truly empty data directories  
3. **Temporary Files**: Only removes `.tmp`, `.cache`, specific temp files
4. **User Confirmation**: Added interactive prompts for risky operations

### **‚úÖ PROTECTIONS Added:**
1. **Virtual Environment**: DISABLED - won't touch `venv/` per user request
2. **Data Directories**: Only removes empty ones, preserves important validation/metrics data
3. **Archive Safety**: Interactive confirmation for backup directories with many files
4. **File Count Checks**: Validates directory contents before deletion

### **‚ö†Ô∏è REMAINING RISKS (Minimal):**
1. **Recursive Cache Removal**: Uses `rglob()` but only for cache directories 
2. **Interactive Prompts**: User could accidentally say "yes" to important directories

### **üéØ RECOMMENDATION:**
**SCRIPT IS NOW SAFE TO USE** with the modifications made. It will:
- ‚úÖ Remove unnecessary cache and build artifacts
- ‚úÖ Clean up empty data directories  
- ‚úÖ Ask permission for anything potentially important
- ‚úÖ Preserve all critical functionality and data
- ‚úÖ Leave `venv/` untouched as requested

The script is now conservative and follows the principle of "better safe than sorry" while still achieving meaningful cleanup.
