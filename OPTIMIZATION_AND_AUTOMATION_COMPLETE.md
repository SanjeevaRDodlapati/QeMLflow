```bash
# Deploy with commit message
./deploy_to_all_remotes.sh "feat: new feature"

# Test authentication
./deploy_to_all_remotes.sh --test

# Check status
./deploy_to_all_remotes.sh --status

# Deploy to specific branch
./deploy_to_all_remotes.sh --branch develop "fix: bug fix"
```

### **Key Benefits**
- ✅ **Eliminates manual errors** in account switching
- ✅ **Comprehensive logging** with colored output
- ✅ **Automatic status tracking** and reporting
- ✅ **Deployment summaries** saved to docs/deployment/
- ✅ **Authentication verification** before deployment
- ✅ **Error recovery** and detailed error reporting
